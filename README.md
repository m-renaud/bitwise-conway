### Bitwise Conway's Game of Life ###

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Conway's
Game of Life using a bit map and low level bit manipulations instead
of the classic 2D array.

Currently, `conway.cxx` has a small bug in it, `bitconway_fast.cxx`
works as it should. I will get around to finding the bug eventually.

Inspiration and assistance from my friend Zak Blacher.
